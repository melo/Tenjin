Tenjin - Fast templating engine with support for embedded Perl.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use Tenjin;

	$Tenjin::USE_STRICT = 1;	# use strict in the embedded Perl inside
					# your templates. Recommended, but not used
					# by default.

	$Tenjin::ENCODING = "utf8";	# set the encoding of your template files
					# to utf8. This is the default encoding used
					# so there's no need to do this if your
					# templates really are utf8.

	my $engine = Tenjin->new(\%options);
	my $context = { title => 'Tenjin Example', items => [qw/AAA BBB CCC/] };
	my $filename = 'file.html';
	my $output = $engine->render($filename, $context);
	print $output;

0.06

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Tenjin is a very fast and full-featured templating engine, implemented in several programming languages, among them Perl.

The Perl version of Tenjin supports embedded Perl code, nestable layout template,
inclusion of other templates inside a template, capturing parts of or the entire
template output, file and memory caching, template arguments and preprocessing.

The original version of Tenjin is developed by Makoto Kuwata. This CPAN
version is developed by Ido Perlmuter and differs from the original in a
few key aspects:

=over

=item * Code is entirely revised, packages are separated into modules, with
a smaller number of packages than the original version. In particular, the
Tenjin::Engine module no longer exists, and is now instead just the Tenjin
module (i.e. this one).

=item * Support for rendering templates from non-files sources (such as
a database) is added.

=item * Ability to set the encoding of your templates is added.

=item * HTML is encoded and decoded using the L<HTML::Entities> module,
instead of internally.

=item * The C<pltenjin> script is not provided, at least for now.

=back

To make it clear, this version of Tenjin might somehow divert from the
original Tenjin's roadmap. Although my aim is to be as compatible as
possible (and this version is always updated with features and changes
from the original), I cannot guarantee it. Please note that version 0.05
of this module is NOT backwards compatible with previous versions.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( \%options )

This creates a new instant of Tenjin. C<\%options> is a hash-ref
containing Tenjin's configuration options:

=over

=item * B<path> - Array-ref of filesystem paths where templates will be searched

=item * B<prefix> - A string that will be automatically prepended to template names
when searching for them in the path. Empty by default.

=item * B<postfix> - The default extension to be automtically appended to template names
when searching for them in the path. Don't forget to include the
dot, such as '.html'. Empty by default.

=item * B<cache> - If set to 1 (the default), compiled templates will be cached on the
filesystem (this means the template's code will be cached, not the completed rendered
output).

=item * B<preprocess> - Enable template preprocessing (turned off by default). Only
use if you're actually using any preprocessed Perl code in your templates.

=item * B<layout> - Name of a layout template that can be optionally used. If set,
templates will be automatically inserted into the layout template,
in the location where you use C<[== $_content ==]>.

=item * B<strict> - Another way to make Tenjin use strict on embedded Perl code (turned
off by default).

=item * B<encoding> - Another way to set the encoding of your template files (set to utf8
by default).

}

=head2 render( $tmpl_name, [\%context, $layout] )

Renders a template whose name is identified by C<$tmpl_name>. Remember that a prefix
and a postfix might be added if they where set when creating the Tenjin instance.

C<$context> is a hash-ref containing the variables that will be available for usage inside
the templates. So, for example, if your C<\%context> is { message => 'Hi there }, then
you can use C<$message> inside your templates.

C<$layout> is the name of the layout template to use. It overrides the
layout defined in the Tejin instance (via the C<layout> option).
When using layouts, the content of the rendered template is
available inside the layout template in the C<< $context->{_content} >>
slot. If you want to use a different layout template for a specific
template, you can set the layout template's name to the context as
'_layout' (C<< $context->{_layout} = 'my_specific_layout'; >>).

Please note that by default file templates are cached on disk (with a '.cache') extension.
Tenjin automatically deprecates these cache files every 10 seconds. If you
find this value is too low, you can override the C<$Tenjin::TIMESTAMP_INTERVAL>
variable with your preferred value.

=head2 register_template( $template_name, $template )

Receives the name of a template and its L<Tenjin::Template> object
and stores it in memory for usage by the engine.

=cut

	my ($self, $template_name, $template) = @_;

	$template->{timestamp} = time;

}

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=head2 get_template( $template_name, $context )

Receives the name of a template and the context object and tries to find
that template in the engine's memory. If it's not there, it will try to find
it in the file system (the cache file might be loaded, if present). Returns
the templates L<Tenjin::Template> object.

=cut

sub get_template {
	my ($self, $template_name, $context) = @_;

	my $template = $self->{templates}->{$template_name};

	## check whether template file is updated or not

		$template = $self->create_template($filepath, $context);  # $context is passed only for preprocessor
		$self->register_template($template_name, $template);
	}

	return $template;
}

=head2 to_filename( $template_name )

Receives a template name and returns the proper file name to be searched
in the file system, which will only be different than C<$template_name>
if it begins with ':', in which case the prefix and postfix configuration
options will be appended and prepended to the template name (minus the ':'),
respectively.

=cut

sub to_filename {
	my ($self, $template_name) = @_;

	if (substr($template_name, 0, 1) eq ':') {
		return $self->{prefix} . substr($template_name, 1) . $self->{postfix};
	}

	return $template_name;
}

=head2 find_template_file( $filename )

Receives a template filename and searches for it in the path defined in
the configuration options (or, if a path was not set, in the current
working directory). Returns the absolute path to the file.

=cut

sub find_template_file {
	my ($self, $filename) = @_;

	my $path = $self->{path};
	if ($path) {

	}
	my $s = $path ? ("['" . join("','", @$path) . "']") : '[]';
	die "Tenjin::Engine: \"$filename not found (path=$s)\".";
}

=head2 read_template_file( $template, $filename, $context )

Receives a template object and its absolute file path and reads that file.
If preprocessing is on, preprocessing will take place using the provided
context object.

=cut

sub read_template_file {
	my ($self, $template, $filename, $context) = @_;

	if ($self->{preprocess}) {
		if (! defined($context) || ! $context->{_engine}) {
			$context ||= {};

		$pp->convert($template->_read_file($filename));
		return $pp->render($context);
	}

	return $template->_read_file($filename, 1);
}

=head2 cachename( $filename )

Receives a template filename and returns its standard cache filename (which
will simply be C<$filename> with '.cache' appended to it.

=cut

sub cachename {
	my ($self, $filename) = @_;

	return $filename . '.cache';
}

=head2 store_cachefile( $cachename, $template )

Receives the name of a template cache file and the corrasponding template
object, and creates the cache file on disk.

=cut

	my ($self, $cachename, $template) = @_;

	my $cache = $template->{script};
	if (defined $template->{args}) {

		$cache = "\#\@ARGS " . join(',', @$args) . "\n" . $cache;
	}
	$template->_write_file($cachename, $cache, 1);
}

=head2 load_cachefile( $cachename, $template )

Receives the name of a template cache file and the corrasponding template
object, reads the cache file and stores it in the template object (as 'script').

=cut

sub load_cachefile {
	my ($self, $cachename, $template) = @_;

	my $cache = $template->_read_file($cachename, 1);
	if ($cache =~ s/\A\#\@ARGS (.*)\r?\n//) {

		my @args = split(',', $argstr);
		$template->{args} = \@args;
	}
	$template->{script} = $cache;
}

=head2 create_template( $filename, $context )

Receives an absolute path to a template file and the context object, reads
the file, processes it (which may involve loading the template's cache file
or creating the template's cache file), compiles it and returns the template
object.

=cut

sub create_template {
	my ($self, $filename, $context) = @_;

	my $cachename = $self->cachename($filename);

Note that the Perl version of Tenjin is refered to as plTenjin on the Tenjin website,
and that, as oppose to this module, the website suggests using a .plhtml extension
for the templates instead of .html (this is entirely your choice).

=head1 CHANGES

Version 0.05 of this module broke backwards compatibility with previous versions.
In particular, the Tenjin::Engine module does not exist any more and is
instead integrated into this one. Templates are also rendered entirely
different (as per changes in the original tenjin) which provides much
faster rendering.

Upon upgrading to versions 0.05 and above, you MUST perform the following changes
for your applications (or, if you're using Catalyst, you must also upgrade
L<Catalyst::View::Tenjin>):

=over

=item * C<use Tenjin> as your normally would, but to get an instance
of Tenjin you must call C<< Tenjin->new() >> instead of the old method
of calling C<< Tenjin::Engine->new() >>.

=item * Remove all your templates cache files (they are the '.cache' files
in your template directories), they are not compatible with the new
templates structure and WILL cause your application to fail if present.

=back

Version 0.06 (this version) restored the layout template feature which was
accidentaly missing in version 0.05, and the ability to call the utility
methods of L<Tenjin::Util> natively inside templates. You will want to
remove your templates' .cache files when upgrading to 0.6 too.

=head1 TODO

=over

=item * Expand pod documentation and properly document the code, which is
hard to understand as it is.

=item * Create tests, adapted from the tests provided by the original Tenjin.

=back
